# Reverse Sentence (freeCodeCamp)
#
# Given a string of words, return a new string with the words in reverse
# order. For example, the first word should be at the end of the returned
# string, and the last word should be at the beginning of the returned
# string.
#
# - In the given string, words can be separated by one or more spaces.
# - The returned string should only have one space between words.
#
# Tests:
# 1. reverse_sentence("world hello") should return "hello world"
# 2. reverse_sentence("push commit git") should return "git commit push"
# 3. reverse_sentence("npm  install   apt    sudo") should return
#    "sudo apt install npm"
# 4. reverse_sentence("import    default   function  export") should return
#    "export function default import"

def reverse_sentence(sentence):
    return " ".join(sentence.split()[::-1])


print(reverse_sentence("world hello"))
print(reverse_sentence("push commit git"))
print(reverse_sentence("npm  install   apt    sudo"))
print(reverse_sentence("import    default   function  export"))
