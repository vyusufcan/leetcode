# Acronym Builder (freeCodeCamp)
#
# Given a string containing one or more words, return an acronym of the
# words using the following constraints:
#
# - The acronym should consist of the first letter of each word
#   capitalized, unless otherwise noted.
# - The acronym should ignore the first letter of these words unless they
#   are the first word of the given string: a, for, an, and, by, and of.
# - The acronym letters should be returned in the order they are given.
# - The acronym should not contain any spaces.
#
# Tests:
# 1. build_acronym("Search Engine Optimization") should return "SEO"
# 2. build_acronym("Frequently Asked Questions") should return "FAQ"
# 3. build_acronym("National Aeronautics and Space Administration")
#    should return "NASA"
# 4. build_acronym("Federal Bureau of Investigation") should return "FBI"
# 5. build_acronym("For your information") should return "FYI"
# 6. build_acronym("By the way") should return "BTW"
# 7. build_acronym("An unstoppable herd of waddling penguins overtakes the
#    icy mountains and sings happily") should return "AUHWPOTIMSH"
