# Tribonacci Sequence (freeCodeCamp)
#
# The Tribonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the
# sum of the three preceding ones. When starting with 0, 0 and 1, the first
# 10 numbers in the sequence are 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44.
#
# Given an array containing the first three numbers of a Tribonacci
# sequence, and an integer representing the length of the sequence, return
# an array containing the sequence of the given length.
#
# - Your function should handle sequences of any length greater than or
#   equal to zero.
# - If the length is zero, return an empty array.
# - Note that the starting numbers are part of the sequence.
#
# Tests:
# 1. tribonacci_sequence([0, 0, 1], 20) should return
#    [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, 149, 274, 504, 927, 1705, 3136, 5768, 10609, 19513]
# 2. tribonacci_sequence([21, 32, 43], 1) should return [21]
# 3. tribonacci_sequence([0, 0, 1], 0) should return []
# 4. tribonacci_sequence([10, 20, 30], 2) should return [10, 20]
# 5. tribonacci_sequence([10, 20, 30], 3) should return [10, 20, 30]
# 6. tribonacci_sequence([123, 456, 789], 8) should return
#    [123, 456, 789, 1368, 2613, 4770, 8751, 16134]
